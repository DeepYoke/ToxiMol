This work explores the ability of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to detoxify molecules at the structural level. We present ToxiMol, the first benchmark designed specifically for this task, covering 11 toxicity remediation tasks with a total of 560 toxic molecules, and provide an evaluation framework (ToxiEval) to assess toxicity reduction, structural validity, and drug-likeness.

## üß¨ Overview



The **ToxiMol** benchmark provides:
- üß™ A curated dataset of **560 toxic molecules** across **11 task types**, including functional group preservation, endpoint-specific detoxification, and mechanism-aware edits.
- üß≠ An expert-informed **Mechanism-Aware Prompt Annotation Pipeline**, tailored for general-purpose and chemical-aware models.

The **ToxiEval** evaluation framework, offering automated assessment on:
  - Safety Score
  - Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness
  - Synthetic Accessibility Score
  - Lipinski‚Äôs Rule of Five
  - Structural Similarity


We systematically test nearly 30 state-of-the-art MLLMs with diverse architectures and input modalities to assess their ability to perform structure-level molecular toxicity repair.



## üìÇ Dataset Structure

The **ToxiMol** dataset consists of 560 curated toxic molecules sampled from 12 established toxicity datasets, covering both binary classification and regression tasks across diverse mechanisms:

## üìä Evaluation

We propose **ToxiEval**, a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of the following metrics:

| Metric                                  | Description                                                                  | Range             | Threshold for Success             |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Safety Score**                   | Indicates toxicity mitigation, based on TxGemma-Predict classification        | 0‚Äì1 or binary     | =1 (binary) or >0.5 (LD50 task)   |
| **Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED)** | Drug-likeness score from [0,1]; higher means more drug-like                   | 0‚Äì1               | ‚â• 0.5                             |
| **Synthetic Accessibility Score (SAS)** | Synthetic feasibility; lower scores are better                                | 1‚Äì10              | ‚â§ 6                               |
| **Lipinski‚Äôs Rule of Five (RO5)**       | Number of Lipinski rule violations (should be minimal)                        | Integer (‚â•0)      | ‚â§ 1                               |
| **Structural Similarity(SS)**               | Scaffold similarity (Tanimoto) between original and repaired molecules        | 0‚Äì1               | ‚â• 0.4                             |


A candidate molecule is considered successfully detoxified **only if it satisfies all five criteria simultaneously**.
