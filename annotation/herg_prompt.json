  "task_description": "Compound with hERG potassium channel inhibition activity, which can lead to QT interval prolongation and potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias",
  "instruction": "Given a molecule represented by both SMILES and its molecular structure image, this compound exhibits hERG potassium channel inhibition, posing a risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially fatal arrhythmias. Please propose structural modifications that reduce hERG binding potential while preserving the compound’s primary pharmacological activity. Focus on reducing known risk factors such as high basicity (pKa > 7.0), excessive lipophilicity (logP > 3.0), and extended aromatic or hydrophobic motifs, while maintaining essential functional groups.",
  "focus_points": [
    "Basic nitrogen atoms with high pKa values that may form strong ionic interactions with acidic residues in the hERG channel",
    "Lipophilic moieties contributing to high logP values (> 3.0), which enhance membrane accumulation and channel affinity",
    "Planar aromatic rings capable of π-π stacking with aromatic residues in the binding pocket",
    "Extended hydrophobic regions that interact with lipophilic domains within the channel",
    "Linear molecular shapes and high molecular weight (typically > 250 Da) that favor deep channel penetration"
  ],
  "output_format": "Please propose structural modifications that may reduce hERG channel binding while maintaining the compound's primary pharmacological activity."
