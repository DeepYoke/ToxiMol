  "task_description": "Compound identified in the Karim et al. dataset as a hERG channel inhibitor with potential cardiotoxicity risks",
  "instruction": "Given molecule with the provided SMILES and molecular structure image, this compound has been identified in the Karim et al. dataset as a hERG channel inhibitor with potential cardiotoxicity risks. Please modify its structure to reduce its hERG inhibition potential while maintaining its therapeutic efficacy.",
  "focus_points": [
    "Positively charged nitrogen atoms that interact with negatively charged residues in the channel",
    "Extended hydrophobic regions that facilitate non-specific binding",
    "Hydrogen bond acceptors positioned at specific distances from basic centers",
    "Planar aromatic features that contribute to Ï€-stacking interactions within the channel",
    "Overall distribution of charge"
  ],
  "output_format": "Please propose modifications that would likely reduce hERG channel affinity while preserving the compound's intended pharmacological target interactions and activity profile."
